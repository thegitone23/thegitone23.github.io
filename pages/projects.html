          This editor has been inspired by - 
          <a
            target="_blank" 
            href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/"
          ><span class="link">the "kilo" text editor.</span></a> 
          Apart from the basic viewing and editing operations, 
          kilo also supports basic syntax highlighting and searching.

          So far, this "Yet Another Kilo" implementation extends 
          a bit on syntax highlighting and improves searching.

          While this project is not a clone/fork (in context of Git), most
          of the code for this editor is from snaptoken's kilo. My intention behind trying this
          out was to experience the challanges involved in directly interacting with the terminal
          and to try some more of the good old C (98).

          Flex Twitter / X followers from your anonymous accounts onto your main account

          It's common for social media users to have anonymous accounts. Well some platforms
          see it more than others. This project is a prototype of a simple idea, why not flex 
          stats from your anon accounts onto your main accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We allow users to link multiple
          X / Twitter accounts, every account has a publicly accessible web page, owner of the 
          account can decide what stats (experimented with just followers) shall be displayed 
          (aggregated from the selected accounts they own).  
          It was a fun little experiment where I got to implement a custom auth flow and
          take care of the things accross the stack.
